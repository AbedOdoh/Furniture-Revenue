# Furniture-Revenue
In this project, Excel was used to clean and prepare the U.S. furniture sales data, perform calculations such as year-over-year changes, and organize key metrics. Power BI was then used to create an interactive dashboard visualizing sales performance, shipping trends, and regional distribution.
